# CSE-323-Operating_Systems_Design- NULLâ€™s Weather Irrigate Hub


# Introduction: 

The NULL's Weather Irrigate Hub is an innovative project aimed at creating a smart irrigation system that helps optimize water usage for gardens or farms. This system will use advanced technology to monitor soil moisture levels, ensuring that plants receive the right amount of water at the right time. The hub will also track weather conditions like temperature, humidity & rain in real-time. This helps make irrigation more efficient, leading to healthier plants & saving water.

# Objectives: 

  - Design & implement a smart irrigation system capable of monitoring soil moisture levels and adjusting irrigation schedules accordingly.
  - A weather monitoring system to gather real-time data on temperature, humidity & precipitation

# Equipment List :

1. Arduino Uno microcontroller -1x
2. I2C module for display
